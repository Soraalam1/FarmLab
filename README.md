GIT FLOW

1. Make sure you are checked into your branch on your console. (**NEVER PUSH TO MASTER!!**)

2. Make sure you are working on a ticket on Trello in the Doing tab. Write comments in your ticket for all the little updates you do.

3. In your branch, do a git pull origin master to be up to date.

4. Complete your work.

5. If you are struggling, move it to help (and feel free to contact someone). 

6. Go back to your console, again make sure you are in your branch, and then you git add -A, git commit -m"comment should be VERY specific", git push (git status to check where you are in the process). 

7. Go on github and create a pull request from your branch to master. 

8. If there's something wrong with it, fix the conflicts. Repeat step 4 and on after.

9. Go work on your next ticket...
